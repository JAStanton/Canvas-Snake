This is my first javascript game. I think the code is pretty clean, I know of some minor bugs but it's pretty good for an afternoon project.

Some cool features, if you take a look at the source code you will notice all it takes is an element with a ID of "score", a canvas element with an id of "snake", width, height, and data-size attributes.

If you adjust width, height, and the block size the speed of the game will adjust accordingly.

Enjoy!
