	<h1>Welcome to Canvas Snake</h1>
	<p>Direction: Spacebar to start / pause, arrow keys to move.</p>

	<canvas id="snake" width="400" height="400" data-size="10"></canvas>  
	<p>This is my first javascript game. I think the code is pretty clean, I know of some minor bugs but it's pretty good for an afternoon project. </p>
	<p>Some cool features, if you take a look at the source code you will notice all it takes is an element with a ID of "score", a canvas element with an id of "snake", width, height, and data-size attributes.</p>
	<p>If you adjust width, height, and the block size the speed of the game will adjust accordingly.</p>
	<p>Enjoy!</p>
